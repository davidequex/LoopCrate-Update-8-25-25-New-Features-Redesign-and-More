    - The Explore Page now has smarter filtering specifically tailored for packs.
    
    - Instead of cluttering results, packs can now be separated from single loops, making browsing more intuitive.
    
    - Producers looking for full packs instead of individual sounds can now find what they need much faster.

**CUSTOM PACK TAGS**

    - This was already an existing feature for singular loop uploads, but users are now able to do this with packs.
    
    - Creators can now add custom tags when uploading packs.
    
    - This makes LoopCrate more searchable, customizable, and closer to how real producers organize their sounds.

**MANAGE PACKS SECTION**

    - With this already being an existing feature with loops, users are now able to edit pack details, private packs, and delete packs if needed.

    - This makes it much easier for creators to keep their library organized over time.
